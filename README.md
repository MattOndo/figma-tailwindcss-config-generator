# TailwindCSS Config Generator for Flowbite

Export Figma Variables and Styles to TailwindCSS configurations and/or CSS variables. Supports both Tailwind 3 (theme config object) and 4 (css variables).

As most Figma -> Tailwind plugins, it does require the variables & styles to be configured a certain way. This plugin was built based on the way variables and styles are configured in the [Flowbite Design System](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1179442320711977498), and other figma templates with design systems based on tailwind.
